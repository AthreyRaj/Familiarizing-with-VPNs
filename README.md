##  Steps Followed

1. Downloaded and installed **ProtonVPN**.
2. Created a free account and logged in.
3. Connected to the **Netherlands** server.
4. Verified IP address change using **whatismyipaddress.com**.
5. Performed **speed test** and loaded multiple websites.
6. Disconnected VPN and compared speed and IP.
7. Researched VPN encryption methods and privacy features.
8. Wrote a summary of key VPN benefits and limitations.

## üì∂ Network Speed Comparison

|                | Without VPN | With VPN     |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| Download Speed | 95 Mbps     | 84 Mbps      |
| Upload Speed   | 95 Mbps     | 93 Mbps      |
| Latency        | 160 ms      | 150 ms       |

**Observation:**  
VPN slowed the internet slightly due to encryption overhead.  
Websites loaded correctly with a small delay.  
IP address and location were successfully masked.

## üîê VPN Encryption & Privacy Features

- **AES-256-bit encryption** ensures military-grade data security.
- **VPN Protocols:** OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec
- **Privacy Features Include:**
  - IP masking and location spoofing
  - No-log policy (for privacy)
  - DNS leak protection
  - Kill switch to protect real IP if VPN disconnects

## üßæ Summary

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) enhances online privacy by encrypting internet traffic and masking the user's IP address, making it difficult for ISPs, hackers, or websites to track activity. It allows users to browse securely, especially on public Wi-Fi, and access geo-restricted content. VPNs use strong encryption protocols like AES-256 and tunneling methods such as OpenVPN or WireGuard to protect data. However, they can slightly reduce internet speed, and free VPNs may have limitations like data caps or weaker privacy policies. While VPNs improve security and anonymity, they do not offer complete invisibility online and should be used alongside other privacy tools for better protection.
